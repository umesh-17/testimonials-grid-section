                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since

                I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
                in particular,
                was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
                fact,
                I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
                helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend ! ”</p>
